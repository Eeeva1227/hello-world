ideas, resources and discussions
Hi, I am a computer science 2nd year student, and I am trying to obtain as much as knowledge and I can either by study online or taking courses at university.
In the meantime, I am trying to keep exercise every other day, it seems like a little bit difficult these days with a bunch of assignments, midterms, and interviews.
However, trying my best and then becoming a better girl is my goal.
oops, forgot to say: Be happy and postitve every day!
